=====
**This repository contains my personal dwm setup.**


All patches were hand patched using various sources and diffed in a queue. This means that to use a patch further down the queue, all patches before it must be applied or some hand patching may be required.


**todo:**
* clean up systray
* powerline_theme - add implicit color defs. for powerline glyphs + clean up code
* remove unused functions and dependencies
